# Plugin hooks

Plugins are no longer just "an extra binary on `$PATH`-via-printer". They can
register **hooks** that fire at specific points in the `printer init` /
`printer exec` lifecycle. A single plugin can ship as many hooks as it wants;
the existing `printer <plugin-name> <args>` dispatch still works alongside.

There are two hook **types**:

- **CLI hooks** — printer runs an arbitrary shell command, with context
  variables interpolated. Use these to notify, log, post artifacts,
  precondition the workspace, etc.
- **Agent hooks** — printer enriches the prompt or available skills for
  the agent session that's about to run. Use these to register a Claude
  skill, force a slash-command-like instruction, or inject phase-specific
  guidance.

## Where hooks come from

Hooks live in installed plugin manifests at:

```
~/.printer/plugins/<plugin-name>/plugin.toml
```

Any plugin manifest may include `[[hooks]]` entries (see schema below). When
you run `printer init` or `printer exec`, every installed plugin's manifest is
read and its hooks are fired at the matching events.

## Hook events

Events fire in this order. `before_*` events run *before* the phase begins;
`after_*` events run *after* it ends, with `{exit_status}` set to either
`ok` or `err`.

### `before_init` / `after_init`

Fires around `printer init`. The spec file has just been written (or is about
to be); `.printer/tasks/` and the codegraph index get bootstrapped between
the two. Useful for:

- CLI: dropping additional config files into the new project, kicking off a
  one-off bootstrap.
- Agent: N/A (no agent runs during init).

### `before_exec` / `after_exec`

Outermost wrapping of `printer exec`. Fires once per invocation, before any
phase decision is made and after the whole pipeline finishes (success **or**
failure). Useful for:

- CLI: notify-on-start / notify-on-finish, push artifacts up to a server.
- Agent: N/A (no single agent session spans exec).

### `before_run` / `after_run`

Wraps the implementation phase (the `run::run` loop). `before_run` is the
right place to **augment every nudge prompt** in the run loop. Agent
hook contributions to `before_run` are folded into the per-turn nudge prompt
in `printer/src/prompts.rs::nudge_prompt`, so they apply for every turn until
the phase ends. Useful for:

- CLI: pre-/post-flight checks (lint, tests, branch state).
- Agent: pin coding-style guidance for the run loop, register a skill the
  implementer should consult, or inject "always run /lint after edits".

### `before_review` / `after_review`

Wraps the review phase (single agent turn). Agent hook contributions to
`before_review` are appended to the review prompt and skill list. Useful for:

- CLI: copy the produced report into a docs site, post the verdict to chat.
- Agent: load a custom security-review skill, force the reviewer to grade
  against an extra rubric.

## Hook schema

Inside a plugin manifest:

```toml
# Existing fields:
name = "..."
version = "..."
binary = "bin/..."
installed_at = "..."

[source]
type = "git" | "path" | "shell"
# ...

# NEW: hooks the plugin registers.

[[hooks]]
type = "cli"
event = "after_review"
command = "notify-slack '#releases' 'review for {spec} finished: {exit_status}'"
# Optional. How to react to a non-zero exit from the hook:
#   "fail"   — abort the printer run (default for before_* events)
#   "warn"   — log a warning, keep going (default for after_* events)
#   "ignore" — silent
on_failure = "warn"

[[hooks]]
type = "agent"
event = "before_review"
# Inject a slash-command-style instruction into the review prompt.
command = "Run /security-review and incorporate its findings into the review."

[[hooks]]
type = "agent"
event = "before_run"
# Path to a SKILL.md (or skill directory containing one). Resolved relative
# to the plugin's directory. The skill is exposed to the agent in the same
# way `printer review --skill` exposes review-time skills.
skill = "skills/our-coding-style/"
```

A single `[[hooks]]` entry must specify exactly one of `command` (CLI or
agent) or `skill` (agent only).

## Available `{variables}` for interpolation

Substituted into CLI `command` strings and agent `command` text:

| Variable          | Available in                          | Meaning                                   |
|-------------------|---------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| `{cwd}`           | all events                            | Working directory printer is operating in |
| `{spec}`          | all events except `before_init`       | Absolute path to the spec file            |
| `{event}`         | all events                            | The event name (`before_run`, …)          |
| `{phase}`         | run / review events                   | `run` or `review`                         |
| `{exit_status}`   | `after_*` events                      | `ok` or `err`                             |
| `{base_ref}`      | review events                        | Git ref used for the review diff          |
| `{report_path}`   | `after_review` (when `--out` set)    | Path where the review report was written  |

Unknown `{vars}` are left in place (so a hook command that uses `{name}` for
its own templating won't be mangled).

## CLI environment

CLI hooks are spawned via `sh -c "<command>"` in the working directory. They
inherit printer's environment plus the following injected vars (mirrors the
interpolation table above; useful when you'd rather read env than template):

```
PRINTER_HOOK_EVENT=after_review
PRINTER_HOOK_PHASE=review
PRINTER_HOOK_CWD=/abs/path
PRINTER_HOOK_SPEC=/abs/path/spec.md
PRINTER_HOOK_EXIT_STATUS=ok
PRINTER_HOOK_BASE_REF=main
PRINTER_HOOK_REPORT_PATH=/abs/path/review.md     # if --out was set
PRINTER_PLUGIN=my-plugin                          # which plugin owns this hook
```

## Authoring a plugin

A plugin's source crate may include an optional `printer-plugin.toml` at
its root. When `printer add-plugin` installs the plugin, this file is read
and its contents are merged into the installed `plugin.toml` and copied
into the install directory. Without this file, plugins install with no
hooks and no extra assets — the historical behaviour.

```toml
# plugins/<name>/printer-plugin.toml

# Files or directories (relative paths only, no `..`) to copy verbatim
# from the source root into the installed plugin dir alongside the
# binary. Hook fields like `skill = "skills/foo/SKILL.md"` resolve
# against the install dir, so anything they reference must be listed here.
assets = ["skills"]

# Hooks have the same schema as `[[hooks]]` in the installed manifest;
# they are validated at install time and refused if malformed.

[[hooks]]
type = "cli"
event = "before_run"
command = "codegraph index"
on_failure = "warn"

[[hooks]]
type = "agent"
event = "before_run"
skill = "skills/codegraph-search/SKILL.md"

[[hooks]]
type = "agent"
event = "before_run"
command = "Prefer `codegraph` over grep + Read for navigation."
```

Notes:

- **Source dir requirement** — `printer-plugin.toml` is only read for
  plugins installed via `path:` or a git URL (cargo crates with a real
  source tree). Shell-installer plugins (`--install-cmd`) have no source
  dir under printer's control, so they cannot ship hooks via this
  mechanism; their hooks must be hand-edited into `plugin.toml`.
- **`cargo install` discards non-binary files** — the only reason your
  `skills/` directory survives the install is the `assets` list. Forget
  to include it and the hook's `skill = "..."` paths will dangle.
- **Validation is strict** — install fails if a hook references an
  unknown event or violates the type/command/skill constraints. Fix the
  source manifest and re-run with `--force`.
- **Path safety** — assets must be relative paths without `..`
  components. Symlinks inside an asset directory are refused. The install
  refuses to clobber pre-existing files in the install dir.

## Listing what's wired up

```
printer hooks list             # all hooks across all installed plugins
printer hooks list --event after_review
```

Shows event, plugin name, kind, and resolved command/skill for each hook.

## Sandbox drivers

In addition to `[[hooks]]`, a plugin manifest may declare a `[driver]` block.
A driver is the plugin role that lets printer dispatch the agent inside an
isolated environment — typically a heyvm worktree — instead of the host cwd.

Only one driver runs at a time. If exactly one plugin contributes a driver
the default `sandbox.driver = "auto"` picks it. If multiple plugins contribute
drivers, printer will refuse to run until you set `sandbox.driver` in
`~/.printer/config.toml` (see "Global config" below) to pick between them.

### Schema

```toml
[driver]
kind = "vm"

# Provision the sandbox. Must print the handle (id / name / path) on stdout —
# printer captures stdout and stores it as `{handle}` for subsequent steps.
# heyvm's normal output is multi-line, so we redirect it to stderr and echo
# the deterministic slug ourselves.
create = "heyvm create --name printer-{spec_slug} --image {base_image} --no-ttl --needs-network --mount {cwd}:/workspace --mount $HOME/.claude:$HOME/.claude >&2 && echo printer-{spec_slug}"

# Wrap each child agent invocation. The `{child}` placeholder is required;
# printer shell-quotes the agent's argv token-by-token and substitutes it
# in. The whole template runs under printer's outer `sh -c`, which parses
# those tokens back into argv. **Do not add another `sh -c` around
# `{child}`** — that would double-shell and pass the agent's flags as
# positional parameters to the inner sh instead of to the agent. `--session
# printer` keeps cwd and exported env consistent across consecutive
# `enter` calls.
enter = "heyvm exec {handle} --session printer --env IS_SANDBOX=1 -- {child}"

# (Optional) sync_in / sync_out push/pull the host cwd to/from the sandbox.
# The bundled heyvm plugin omits both because cwd is bind-mounted via
# `--mount` at create time, so file edits round-trip live and there is
# nothing to copy. Drivers backed by transports that *do* need an explicit
# copy step (e.g. an SSH-only remote) would set them.

# (Optional) Tear the sandbox down. Runs from `Drop`, so it fires on panic
# and on early returns too. Failures are logged and swallowed — sync_out and
# destroy are best-effort cleanup.
destroy = "heyvm delete -y {handle}"

# (Optional) Preflight script run *inside* the sandbox right after `create`
# succeeds. printer wraps it through `enter` automatically. Failure here
# tears the sandbox down and aborts the run; use shell short-circuits
# (`|| true`) if you want a step to be best-effort. The bundled heyvm
# manifest uses this to `cd /workspace` once so subsequent `enter` calls
# inherit cwd via the persistent `--session`.
post_create = "cd /workspace"
```

### Lifecycle

For `printer exec`, the sandbox covers both phases — one `create` per exec,
one `destroy` at the end:

1. `create`   — once, at the top of `exec` (or `run` / `review` standalone).
2. `sync_in`  — once, after create.
3. `enter`    — wraps every agent turn for both run and review phases.
4. `sync_out` — once, after both phases finish.
5. `destroy`  — fires from the sandbox guard's `Drop`.

`printer run` and `printer review` invoked directly (without `exec`) each
manage their own create/destroy lifecycle.

### `{variables}` for driver templates

| Variable       | Available in              | Meaning                                          |
|----------------|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `{cwd}`        | all steps                 | Working directory printer is operating in        |
| `{spec}`       | all steps                 | Absolute path to the spec file                   |
| `{spec_slug}`  | all steps                 | Spec basename, sanitized for use as a sandbox name (alphanumerics, `-`, `_` only) |
| `{base_image}` | all steps                 | `sandbox.base_image` from `~/.printer/config.toml` |
| `{handle}`     | all steps after `create`  | Whatever `create` printed on stdout              |
| `{child}`      | `enter` only (required)   | Shell-quoted argv of the wrapped agent command   |

### Skipping the sandbox

`printer run`, `printer review`, and `printer exec` all accept `--no-sandbox`
to dispatch on the host even when a driver is installed. Useful for local
debugging when the driver itself is misbehaving.

## Global config

User-level preferences live in `~/.printer/config.toml`. The file is optional;
anything you omit falls back to built-in defaults. Use `printer config show`
to print the resolved values, and `printer config edit` to open the file in
`$EDITOR` (it is seeded from a default template if missing).

```toml
[sandbox]
# Which driver-contributing plugin to dispatch through.
#   "auto" — pick the only installed driver (errors if more than one).
#   "off"  — never sandbox, even if a driver is installed.
#   "<plugin-name>" — pick a specific driver by plugin name.
driver = "auto"

# Forwarded to the driver's templates as {base_image}. For the bundled heyvm
# plugin this is the image string passed to `heyvm create --image …` (e.g.
# "ubuntu:24.04", "alpine:3.19", or any image heyvm knows about).
base_image = "ubuntu:24.04"

# Names of env vars to forward into the sandbox. Driver-specific.
env = []

# Extra read/write mounts (host:guest), beyond cwd which is mounted by default.
mounts = []

# Per-step overrides on top of the active driver's manifest. Any key you set
# here replaces that step's template; anything you omit falls through to the
# plugin's default. Same `{var}` interpolation as the plugin's [driver] block.
[sandbox.commands]
# create  = "heyvm create --name printer-{spec_slug} --image {base_image} --no-ttl --needs-network --mount {cwd}:/workspace --mount $HOME/.claude:$HOME/.claude >&2 && echo printer-{spec_slug}"
# enter   = "heyvm exec {handle} --session printer --env IS_SANDBOX=1 -- {child}"
# destroy = "heyvm delete -y {handle}"
# sync_in / sync_out are unset for the heyvm driver: cwd is bind-mounted at
# create time, so file edits round-trip live.

# Optional preflight inside the sandbox, run right after `create`. Wrapped via
# `enter`. Failure aborts the run; use shell short-circuits to make a step
# best-effort.
# post_create = "bash -lc 'cargo fetch || true'"
```

The override merge happens before any sandbox is created, and the merged
spec is re-validated — so a config typo (`enter` missing `{child}`, an empty
`create`) fails fast with a clear error rather than silently breaking the run.

`--no-sandbox` on the CLI is equivalent to `sandbox.driver = "off"` for the
duration of one command.

## ACP agents

`printer run` / `review` / `exec` / `plan` / `spec-from-followups` accept
`--agent acp` alongside the existing `claude` and `opencode` choices. ACP is
the [Agent Client Protocol](https://agentclientprotocol.com) — a long-lived
JSON-RPC 2.0 stdio transport spoken by agents like `claude-code-acp` and
Poolside, where one process serves the whole printer session instead of being
re-spawned per turn.

### Selecting an ACP server

Two ways to point printer at the server binary:

1. **Inline flags** — pass `--acp-bin <command>` (and optionally repeated
   `--acp-arg <arg>` to append extra argv tokens):

   ```
   printer run spec.md --agent acp --acp-bin claude-code-acp
   ```

2. **Plugin-contributed agent** — an installed plugin may declare one or
   more `[[agent]]` blocks that name a launch command. Pick one by name:

   ```
   printer run spec.md --agent acp:poolside
   ```

   `--acp-bin` (if also passed) overrides the manifest's `command`;
   `--acp-arg` tokens are appended after the manifest's `args`.

#### Plugin manifest schema

Inside a plugin manifest (or the `printer-plugin.toml` shipped at the source
root) declare one block per agent:

```toml
[[agent]]
kind = "acp"
# Lookup name. Must be unique across every installed plugin's manifests.
# Reserved names (`claude`, `opencode`, `acp`) are refused at install time
# because they would shadow the built-in --agent choices.
name = "poolside"
# Launch command (binary on $PATH, or absolute path). Required.
command = "poolside"
# Argv tokens appended to `command`. Optional.
args = ["acp"]
# Env vars passed to the spawned child. Values are taken as literal strings
# — no shell expansion. Optional.
env = { POOLSIDE_LOG = "info" }
```

`printer plugins` shows `agent` in the `ROLES` column for any plugin that
contributes at least one `[[agent]]` block.

#### Worked example: bundled `plugins/poolside/`

The repo ships a reference ACP plugin at `plugins/poolside/`. Its
`printer-plugin.toml` is exactly the schema above — `command = "poolside"`,
`args = ["acp"]`, plus a `before_run` agent skill (`skills/poolside/`)
that briefs the implementer to follow host-repo conventions instead of
imposing Poolside defaults. Install it with
`printer add-plugin path:plugins/poolside` and dispatch with
`printer run --agent acp:poolside <spec>`. See
`plugins/poolside/README.md` for the full install/use story and
prerequisites (the `poolside` CLI must be on `$PATH`).

### Sandbox interaction

If a sandbox driver is active, the same `enter = "... {child}"` template that
wraps one-shot agents also wraps the ACP server launch — the long-lived child
runs inside the sandbox just like a per-turn child would. Skip with
`--no-sandbox` for host-side debugging.

### What's wired in this release

T-017 ships the **blocking-turn** transport: `initialize` → `session/new` →
`session/prompt` per turn, with all `session/update` text content blocks
concatenated into the agent's reply. Token usage is not yet surfaced (ACP
doesn't standardize a usage shape) so the compaction-by-rotation trigger will
not fire mid-session. Streaming-to-stderr, Ctrl-C cancellation via
`session/cancel`, and permission-mode mapping are tracked on T-020.

## Backwards compatibility

- `printer add-plugin <spec>` works exactly as before. A plugin without
  `[[hooks]]` or `[driver]` in its manifest contributes nothing (and
  dispatches via `printer <name> <args>` as it always has).
- `printer plugins` keeps listing installed plugins; the table now shows a
  `ROLES` column distinguishing `bin` / `hooks` / `driver` contributions.
- The new hook and driver systems are purely additive: a manifest with no
  `[[hooks]]` and no `[driver]` recovers the old behaviour.
