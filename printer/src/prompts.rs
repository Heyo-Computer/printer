1. Read `{spec}`. Treat its checklist as the requirements that were supposed to be delivered.\n\
2. Inspect the working tree changes against the git ref `{base}`. Use `git diff {base}...HEAD` and \
`git status` (and `git diff` for unstaged work) to see what actually changed. Read the relevant \
changed files.\n\
3. Look for an `AGENTS.md` at the repo root (and in the immediate subdirectory containing the \
changed files, if applicable). If present, treat it as authoritative for how to build, test, and \
lint this project — its `Build`, `Test`, and `Lint` (or equivalently named) sections list the \
commands to run. Follow it before falling back to inferring commands from `CLAUDE.md`, \
`README.md`, `Makefile`, `justfile`, `package.json` scripts, `Cargo.toml`, `pyproject.toml`, \
`go.mod`, etc. If `AGENTS.md` exists but is silent on a specific check, note that and infer.\n\
4. Verify the change actually works — do not stop at static reading. Run the build/test/lint \
commands identified in step 3 via your shell tool: typecheck/build, the test suite (or the \
targeted tests covering the changed code), and any linter the repo already uses. If the change \
touches a desktop UI or web app, do NOT stop at tests — exercise the running app end-to-end. \
Start the app (or `computer browse <local URL>` for a web app), then use the `computer` skill \
to drive the affected flow and capture before/after screenshots as evidence in the report. \
Input synthesis is allowed here because the app, not the repo, is being mutated; the read-only \
contract still applies to project files. If `$WAYLAND_DISPLAY` is unset (no display in this \
sandbox), say so explicitly in the report instead of silently skipping the click-test. \
Capture the actual exit codes and key output lines — do not assume green. If the build/tests \
do not exist or cannot run in this environment, say so explicitly in the report rather than \
silently skipping.\n\
5. Produce a concise markdown review report on stdout with these sections:\n\
   - `## Verdict` — one of: PASS, PARTIAL, FAIL. A change that does not build or whose tests \
fail is at most PARTIAL, and FAIL if the failure is in code the spec asked for.\n\
   - `## Verification` — bullet list of the build/test/lint commands you actually ran and their \
result (pass/fail + the meaningful line of output). If the change has a UI/web surface, also list \
the click-test steps you actually performed (or an explicit 'no UI surface' / 'no display \
available' line) so absence of UI verification is visible, not silent. If you skipped a check, \
say why.\n\
   - `## Per-item findings` — for each checklist item in `{spec}`, mark MET / PARTIAL / MISSING and \
explain in one line why, citing files/lines.\n\
   - `## Out-of-scope or risky changes` — anything modified that is not justified by the spec, \
including possible regressions.\n\
   - `## Suggested follow-ups` — short bulleted list, or 'none'.\n\
\n\
Be terse and concrete. Cite file paths. No preamble, no closing summary, no restating of the \
verdict outside the `## Verdict` section. You may run read-only and build/test commands; do NOT \
edit source files, create commits, or otherwise mutate the working tree (build artifacts and \
